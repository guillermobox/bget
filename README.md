Lightweight BitTorrent Client
-----------------------------

Just a lightweight BitTorrent client, wrote to learn about the protocol and to
download/seed contents from bt in cloud machines or just machines in which you
don't want to install a full bt client. But mostly to learn about the protocol.

Nowadays, is able to download, and verify any torrent with only one file
involved. Multifile support is not implemented. And some other things, like
encryption, and a more intelligent swarm manipulation, will never be.
