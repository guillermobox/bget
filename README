Bget - Like wget, but using bitorrent
-------------------------------------

This is a lightweight bittorrent client, wrote to learn about the protocol.
Use it to download bitorrent contents like you could use wget to download any
file form a http or ftp server, but from this P2P network.

Only supports one torrent at a time, and no support for fancy features is
implemented. You can use a magnet link or a torrent file to start the download,
and also supports for resume from disk state. By default, this client will seed
the file until the ratio is 1:1, after that, it will close automatically. This,
along with the limits of upload/download/connections and more, can be configured
in command line or using the configuration file per user (~/.bget).
